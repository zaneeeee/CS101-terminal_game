This is a simple terminal game created with Python. The game is based on the TV game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." Players are asked multiple-choice questions and must answer each question correctly to advance. For each correct answer, they earn points, however, if they asnwer a single question incorrect, they lose the game.

To get started with this game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Clone or download the wwtbam.py file from this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

`python wwtbam.py`

This will start the game.

## Game Features:

The game includes the following features:
- A banner with the game's name is displayed when the script is run.
- A list of 12 pre-designed questions is included in the script.
- The order of questions and answers is randomised each new game.

- If the player answers all questions correctly, they win the maximum prize of 1 million points.
- The game can be restarted or quit at the end of the game.
