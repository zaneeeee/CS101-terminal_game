This is a simple terminal game created with Python. The game is based on the TV game show "Who Wants to be a Millionaire." Players are asked multiple-choice questions and must answer each question correctly to advance. For each correct answer, they earn points, however, if they asnwer a single question incorrect, they lose the game.

## Getting Started:

To get started with this game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. Clone or download this repository and run the following command in your terminal:

`python wwtbam.py`

This will start the game.

## Game Features:

The game includes the following features:
- A banner with the game's name in ASCII art is displayed when the script is run.
- A list of pre-designed questions, options and answers is imported from an external file.
- The order of questions and answers is randomised each new game.
- If the player selects the correct answer, their score increases and they are presented with a new question. 
- If they answer incorrectly, the game is over and their final score is displayed.
- If the player answers all questions correctly, they win the maximum prize of 1 million points.
- The game can be restarted or quit at the end of the game.
